Get credit for your content. Whenever someone selects text on your site, your page title and URL will be included in the footer of the copied text.

== Description ==

1. Get credit for your content. Whenever someone selects more than 40 characters from your web page and clicks the "Copy" link, your page title and URL will be included in the footer of the copied text. No longer will excerpts of your paragraphs float around AIM, or other places on the web, without attribution.

2. Improve word of mouth. Or word of email anyway. Just like the copy functionality, your users will also be presented with the option to directly embed the excerpt in a newly composed email within Outlook, Gmail or Yahoo Mail.

3. Go new-media viral. Make it easier for people to tweet about you. If you've got a younger audience, this twitter option will be a mass-promotion alternative to the more direct but confined email.

4. Provide context. Odds are, if you're writing anything worth reading about, a large chunk of your audience will want more details on the content they're unfamiliar with. With this script, they can get the biography of an unfamiliar politician, Google search results for related pages, or the set of fast-facts that Wolfram Alpha is quickly becoming known to provide.

5. Keep visitors longer. All of the aforementioned actions can be done while keeping your page open. As a result, your visitors will stay on your page longer, and unsurprisingly, they will also be more likely to continue to another page within your site. Plus, (if you'll allow my speculation...) as search engines use visitor retention metrics more and more to determine a site's value, it seems likely that you'll be positioning yourself to benefit with new search traffic too.

== Changelog ==

Wordpress saved plugin to path /search-and-share/ while the php file was using /SearchAndShare/. I corrected the php file to use wordpress's path.

== Screenshots ==
1. Wikipedia having been selected / slid down on the screen.

2. In the process of selecting text, to be copy / pasted.

3. Text having been copy/pasted, revealing the title and url at bottom of the pasted text.

== Installation ==


1. Upload 'plugin-name.php' to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory

2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

3. Highlight text, see if it works.

4. If it doesn't work, your theme may have been built improperly. Simply make sure that &lt;?php wp_footer(); ?&gt; appears near the bottom of your footer.php file (directly above &lt;/body&gt; ... you can copy / paste it in yourself).

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I use this without wordpress? =

Absolutely! Ultimately, this is a jQuery plugin. But for WP users who don't like to muddle around code, I've made an easy installer.
